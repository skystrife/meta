- in progress

   Different retrieval methods than Okapi
   Compression implemented for indexes
   Write parse tree preprocessor stuff in hadoopable format
   Update doxygen!!
   Add more data to 6authors!
   Try out libsvm (looks pretty easy; only question is number of dimensions)
   Add getCategory function in Document; clean up tiebreaking code in KNN
 - unit testing framework
 - Function words tokenizer (is it broken or does it just suck?)
 x Confusion matrix output
 x Ensure ParseTree functions are working 100%, make some unit tests
 x File compression
 x Make preprocessors take list of files as argument
 x KNN ensemble classification (normalize search results, interpolate)
 x POS tokenizer
 x vector -> deque in ngram tokenizer
 x Remove Snowball stemmer and use my C++ stemmer
 x POS preprocessor
 x Sentence preprocessor
