x done
- in progress

   Different retrieval methods than Okapi
   Compression implemented for indexes
   Write parse tree preprocessor stuff in hadoopable format
   Clean up tiebreaking code in KNN
 - parallelize liblinear
 - have liblinear output TP, FP, TN, FN for eval usage
 - clean up liblinear naming in this project
 - Function words tokenizer (is it broken or does it just suck?)
 x Update doxygen!!
 x Unit testing framework
 x Add getCategory function in Document
 x Try out liblinear (apparently this is better for high-dimensional feature space)
 x Confusion matrix output
 x Ensure ParseTree functions are working 100%, make some unit tests
 x File compression
 x Make preprocessors take list of files as argument
 x KNN ensemble classification (normalize search results, interpolate)
 x POS tokenizer
 x vector -> deque in ngram tokenizer
 x Remove Snowball stemmer and use my C++ stemmer
 x POS preprocessor
 x Sentence preprocessor
 x Move KNN from indices to ensemble (can be used as one method)
